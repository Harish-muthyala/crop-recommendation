# crop-recommendation
We import the necessary libraries, including pandas for data manipulation and scikit-learn for machine learning.
We load a sample dataset (you should replace it with a real agricultural dataset).
We split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
We create a decision tree classifier (you can use more advanced models like random forests or neural networks).
We train the classifier on the training data.
We make predictions on the test data and calculate the accuracy of the model.
Finally, we use the trained model to recommend a crop based on new input data.
